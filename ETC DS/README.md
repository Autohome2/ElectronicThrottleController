# DStage ETC DS
The "DS" stands for DSpeed as this version of ETC is dedicated for the Speeduino ECU by DStage called DSpeed: https://github.com/DStageGarage/DSpeed
It is based on HW version 2 howere it lacks the optional Arduino Nano module - as it is installed directly in the ECU some users can connect directly to ECU pins to creat gas pedal map if desired.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that this is a new project and has not yet been tested. It contains some crucial changes over ETCv2 such as the H-brdgethe being an integrated circuit intead of individual components. ALso the Layout is significantly different. Therefore there's no way of telling if it will behave as expected at the moment.

FOr calibration instructions please use same sheet as for DSTage_ETCv2.2 - [DStage_ETC_v2.2_calibration.xlsx](https://github.com/DStageGarage/ElectronicThrottleController/blob/main/ETC%20v2/v2.2/DStage_ETC_v2.2_calibration.xlsx).
