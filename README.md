# ElectronicThrottleController
This is an open HW project of Electronic Throttle Controller also known as Drive By Wire, created by Filip from DStage garage.

The board is purely analogue, no programming required and no chance of failure due to MCU hang-up, flash disappearing due to harsh engine environment etc. Safety was a priority with this one ;-) It also has build in simple fail safes - in case any of the control wires is broken or shorted with power for example the throttle will close automatically.

The board shape is designed to fit popular aluminium casing to be found in tme.eu, Farnell etc. There are no connectors, wires are soldered directly to the board to keep it compact.
